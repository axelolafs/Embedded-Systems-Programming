Memory footprint of 1000 size array of various typesize

int: 2000/2048 bytes
int8_t: 1000/2048 bytes
int16_t: 2000/2048 bytes
int32_t: 4000/2048 bytes
int64_t 8000/2048 bytes

The processor memory is exceeded for 32bit integers and larger.
We can infer that the compiler allocates 2 bytes to a int type, since it uses the same amount of memory as a 16bit integer
and it takes 2000 bytes to store 1000 integers, 2000 bytes/1000 integers = 2byte/integer.
