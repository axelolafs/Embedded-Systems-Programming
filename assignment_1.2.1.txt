Part 1
Memory used for program without class definition
RAM:   [          ]   0.0% (used 0 bytes from 2048 bytes)
Flash: [          ]   0.5% (used 164 bytes from 30720 bytes)

Part 2
Memory used for program with driver implementation
RAM:   [          ]   0.0% (used 0 bytes from 2048 bytes)
Flash: [          ]   0.5% (used 160 bytes from 30720 bytes)

Seems like there is a marginally smaller footprint with a driver which seems strange.
