Assignment 2.2

Part 1

Memory usage:
RAM:   [=====     ]  48.9% (used 1002 bytes from 2048 bytes)
Flash: [=====     ]  46.1% (used 14162 bytes from 30720 bytes)
The vast majority of the memory usage is probably the operating system itself, this is considerably larger memory use than in the bare metal implementation

Cannot see any degredation in performance
