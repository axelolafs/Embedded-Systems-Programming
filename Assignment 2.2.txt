Assignment 2.2

Part 1

Memory usage:
RAM:   [=====     ]  48.9% (used 1002 bytes from 2048 bytes)
Flash: [=====     ]  46.1% (used 14162 bytes from 30720 bytes)
The vast majority of the memory usage is probably the operating system itself, this is considerably larger memory use than in the bare metal implementation

Cannot see any degredation in performance


Part 2
* The LED doesn't blink because as the thread sleeps, the main programs continues to run and when its returned the program ends.

* The LED doesn't blink because as the thread sleeps, the main program enters the infinite loop which is blocking and doesn't allow the OS to return to the task.

* Changing the priority doesn't seem to have an effect.

* The LED blinks because now the loop isn't blocking and the OS has time to serve the threads.

* Seems that the scheduler is preemptive as the system reads other bits of code as it is sleeping.

* Memory size: The RAM memory is approximately 300 bytes larger, largely due to the fact that 256 bytes are allocated to the thread that runs the blinking task.
RAM:   [======    ]  63.4% (used 1298 bytes from 2048 bytes)
Flash: [=====     ]  46.1% (used 14152 bytes from 30720 bytes)
